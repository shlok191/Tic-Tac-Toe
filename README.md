# Tic-Tac-Toe
This a gaming project I uptook when I was 13 years old. The game is developed with C++, using the SQL 2.0 library. I have tried my best to use the graphics available to make the best game of tic-tac-toe possible. Anyone who wishes to use parts of my code or my entire project for use is free to do, as long as they mention that they have taken the help of this repository to do.

Finally, if anyone does open this repository, these are instructions to run the game :-

Download the files of this repository and save them all in a folder.
Run TicTacToe.exe
That's all :)
